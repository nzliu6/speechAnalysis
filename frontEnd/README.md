How to run the front end program:

1. Run the following in your terminal:
   npm install -g expo-cli

2. Go inside the frontEnd directory, and run the following commands:

expo install  
npm install  
npx pod-install

This is going to install the node and pod dependencies. Pod is used as a package
manager for IOS.

3. Run expo start
   (Do not run npm start. There's a bug involving npm start that still hasnt been
   addressed on Github)

Then, a process should run on your local host that will open up automatically in
your browser. Choose to open with IOS Simulator and the program should run.
